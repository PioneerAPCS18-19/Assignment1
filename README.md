# Assignment 1

For this assignment you will use variables and assign them values using basic arithmetic to output the following:

1. The area of a triangle given a base of 6 meters and a height of 10 meters (half base times height).
2. The circumference and area of a circle with a radius of 15 meters (2 times 3.14159 times radius, 3.14159 times radius squared).

Your output should look just like below:

```
Area = 30 meters squared
Circumference = 94.2477 meters
Area = 706.85775 meters squared
```

**Note: it is fine if yours says 30.0 instead of 30.**
